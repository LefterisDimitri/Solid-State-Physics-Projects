Monte-Carlo simulations


(1) Create a computer program that derives the average from N random numbers obtained from a 
uniformly random distribution of numbers in space [0 to 1]. The program must run for N = 10, 100, 1000,
10000, 100000, 1000000 random numbers. Make the graph of the mean as a function of N (where the N 
axis is logarithmic). Describe what conclusions you draw from the results. Use your personal ID number 
as the original seed (as in all subsequent problems). 

(2) Create a program that performs a random walk for N = 1000 steps, in the case of systems (a) 1 
dimension and (b) 2 dimensions. The program must calculate the square of the displacement, R^2. Run the program for 10000 runs and find the R^2 average. 

(3) Use the previous program to determine <R^2>, but now every 100 steps, from 1 to 1000. Find the 
average for 10000 runs. Make a graph of the results. Find the optimal straight line using the least squares 
method. Comment on your results.
